# Contributing & Submission Guidelines

## Workflow (Mandatory)
1. **Fork** `rhack-cyber/Projects-` to your account.
2. **Clone** your fork locally.
3. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feature/<short-desc>`
4. Work and commit frequently.
5. Push the branch to your fork.
6. Open a Pull Request (PR) to `rhack-cyber/Projects-:main`.
7. Use the PR template. Add the label `ready-for-review`.
8. Wait for reviewer comments and address them in the same branch.
9. After approval, instructor/maintainer will merge the PR.

## Repo Structure (required)
- README.md
- /docs/report.pdf
- /src/
- /deliverables/screenshots/
- /.gitignore
- /LICENSE

## Important rules
- **Do not** commit secrets (API keys, passwords). Use `.env` and `.gitignore`.
- Heavy binaries (video >25MB) must be uploaded to Drive, not the repo.
- Include final report both in `/docs/report.pdf` and the Drive folder.
