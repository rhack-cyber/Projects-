Description
This is a minor cybersecurity project that provides a command-line utility to analyze the strength of a password. The script evaluates a password based on several common security criteria, including length, and the presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It then provides a clear strength rating and specific feedback to the user on how to improve their password.

How to run:
-Ensure you have Python installed. This script requires Python 3.
-Navigate to the src directory of the project in your terminal.
-Run the script from the command line:
    Bash
    python password_analyzer.py
    
You will be prompted to enter a password, which will not be visible as you type, for security.
